#### Artificial Intelligence
The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, natural language understanding, decision-making, and translation between languages.

#### Completion
The text that the API generates based on the prompt

#### Model Cutoff Date
The model harvested data up to October 2019.  It will not be aware of any events after the cutoff date.

#### Prompt
“prompt” is text input to the API

#### Stochastic
API is stochastic by default, meaning that every time you call it you might get a slightly different completion, even if the prompt stays the same.

#### Temperature
A number from 0.0 to 1.0 on the randomness of a completion.  0.0 values are consistent.  1.0 have high variability.  Change the temperature up if you want more creative text generated.
